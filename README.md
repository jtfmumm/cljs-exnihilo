# cljs-exnihilo

A Lein template for ClojureScript projects.

## Usage

First navigate to the location where you want your project directory to go.  Then create the project:

```bash
lein new cljs-exnihilo name-of-project
```

Now run cljsbuild to initially compile cljs files.  Leave this running in the background if you want to recompile the cljs files whenever you change them:

```bash
cd name-of-project
lein cljsbuild auto
```

In a separate terminal, navigate to your directory and start the ring server:

```bash
cd name-of-project
lein ring server
```

You are now ready to edit your project in LightTable, or whichever IDE you prefer.
